# Text message reminders for undergraduate STEM students.

The goal of the project is to help undergraduate STEM students at Vanderbilt, because STEM students here constantly seem stressed out with coursework. From an anecdotal perspective, it seems that students in the humanities often get free extensions for late essays, while STEM students often talk about hard deadlines and a lot of work. The goal is to create an application that will help STEM students get reminders for when their assignments are due since missed deadlines are often so catastrophic for STEM students.


Moreover, I have personally heard of stories of students in Peabody college who will get personal text messages from professors, but have never heard of similar stories with STEM majors. One possible reason may be because STEM professors are concerned about privacy and don't want to give their phone number away. Another reason could be that with so many students in classes, it is very hard to send personal messages to all of them. The existing application framework allows users to anonymously send text messages to a centralized source, and the messages are forwarded to by the system to a group of other users. This seems like it would solve both potential hurdles because students would not be able to see their professors' phone numbers, and because professors could send messages to the entire class at once.


To see if this idea interested any undergraduate STEM majors, I interviewed three STEM majors who are all pre-med students; it seems that pre-med students are more worried about grades and classes than any other group on campus. The questions were mostly open ended in asking what the students wanted to see and what they would be willing to participate in. While the sample size is quite small, it might be possible to infer that many STEM students would be interested in getting text message reminders. Of course, the reminders could be used in any classes; it just seems that some students in Peabody college may not need it because they already communicate with professors via text message.
 


# Questions
1). Do you currently use text messaging for anything other than communicating with contacts?1). Do you currently use text messaging for anything other than communicating with contacts?

2). What would be a feature within a text messaging application that would be useful for you and make you likely to use the application?

3). What do you think are the advantages of text messaging over social media?

4). In what ways do you think Vanderbilt as an entity needs to communicate better with students?

5). How likely would you be willing to test a prototype of a text messaging application?

6). In what ways do you think text messaging could facilitate communication between students and professors in large lectures (if any)?

7). In what ways do you think text messaging could facilitate communication between students and professors outside of the classroom (if any)?

8). In what ways would you like communication between students in the same course improved? Do you think any of it could be done through a text messaging application?

9). Would you be more likely to use a text messaging application or Brightspace for reminders? Why?

10). How likely would you be willing to answer questions voluntarily for a text messaging application? Ask them? 

# Answers:

## Question 1:
a). No

b). No

c). Yes

## Question 2:
a). Easier for messages to show up on phone (like how Facebook pops up with a bubble).

b). Not sure, I already have an app for everything they need already.

c). Make it more convenient to communicate with people. 

## Question 3:
a). Don’t have to worry about parents (pure communication). You can call people and do stuff on your phone at the same time (Facebook call might lock you out of doing other stuff).

b). Sometimes it is just more convenient; I have started using text messaging a lot more since I got an iPhone because it is more convenient than Android text messaging.

c). You don't have to have data or wifi. 

## Question 4:
a). Do more than rely on long emails. Social media requires you to check. Appreciate the warning stuff sent as texts; it would be nice if they sent more important reminders over texts, such as add/drop period.

b). A lot of students would like to know the overall goals of the administration more clearly, such as why housing choices are made. Emails as a medium are good though, because user is willing to scroll through them rather than ignore them.

c). Vanderbilt communicates quite well already. 

## Question 5
a). Very willing to.

b). Fairly willing to do so for a friend.

c). Somewhat likely

## Question 6
a). People who are afraid to raise their hand could ask a question using text messaging.

b). Some students may be too shy to raise their hands, so if students could ask questions anonymously, students might be more willing to ask questions.

c). Use it have students to ask questions in class. 

## Question 7
a). A lot of professors prefer text over email already, but it depends on how personal the professors are. Peabody professors are a lot more personal and may be more willing to text students, as well as have group messages with students.

b). Text messages are more casual and convenient than emails, so if a student would want to ask a question, they could ask via a text message. 

c). Maybe it would be useful for facilitating a meetup or asking a question, although email is available. 

## Question 8
a). Not sure if communication needs to be improved. Platform may not be needed because there is already Piazza/find people in class. People usually don’t want to discuss things even though there are platforms.

b). If there a group text message, students might be more willing to clarify between themselves. 

c). Not sure, things seem fine now. 

## Question 9
a). Text messaging would be pretty neat. Brightspace makes it hard to juggle multiple classes because you can only open one at a time.

b). Just as likely for either one since Brightspace actually has a system to send out reminders via text message. However, the current Brightspace feature sometimes cuts off at half of the message, and you can’t see the entire message unless you log into Brightspace.

c). Text messaging.

## Question 10
a). Would be more willing to answer questions if he doesn’t get every question but only a few of them. Would be very unlikely to ask questions.

b). Not very likely to answer questions; would need some incentive to answer questions for others. Pretty unlikely to submit questions for others.

c). Very unlikely to answer questions. Fairly willing to ask questions.
